    % \item Boot ROM - A ROM containing the initial boot sequence of a unit. In the context of a Game Boy, the boot sequence where the Nintendo logo is displayed.
  %  \item MVP - Minimum Viable Product, is within Lean Startup\cite{Lean} considered a product which allows a team to collect maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort\cite{Lean}. Within this context another definition could be a bare bones product which still could be considered a complete product.

   % \item KPI - Key Performance Indicators demonstrate how well and effectively a team is working.
    \item \texttt{0x} - Using the \texttt{0x} prefix indicates that the following value is to be interpreted as a hexadecimal value. For example the value \texttt{0xA0} is to be interpreted as 160.
